# Harry Plotter

A collection of code designed to generalise the process of taking a ROOT ntuple and producing a nice plot in pyplot. The aim is to allow the user to produce a generic configuration file to specify options for plotting.
This is still all under development but will hopefully include:

* Handling of statistical and systematic variations         [DONE]
* Merging of inputs samples across years of data taking     [DONE]
* MC Sample reweighting to data in bins of a given variable
* Output figures generated with pyplot
* Ratio plots (including stacked histograms)
* Cutomisable aesthetics e.g. colour schemes, histo styles, marker sizes etc
* Output figures generated with ROOT
